# viperHTML: Declarative Back End

The `index.js` file is the entry point to your Node JS Application.

You can flush outputs once, or stream them asynchronously.

You can have many Promises within the view without order problems.

You can also do pretty much everything you could do with `hyperHTML`.

Inline styles and JS code are minified out of the box.

Feel free to write layouts as you like, everything will be optimized for you.
